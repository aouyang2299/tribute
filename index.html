      Elena was my teammate in the International Socioeconomics Laboratory Summer Research Fellowship this summer. She is inspiring because she puts a lot of effort into getting the things she needs to get done finished. Elena is a determined individual and will find a solution to any problem she encounters. Not only that, her reliability is one of her best traits as she is able to help others around her and collaborate effectively. Even if the problem in question is not easy to answer like errors in R Studio, she tries her best to solve it. Her work ethic is just part of who she is and she is also very amicable and a fun person to talk to. She inspires me to continue working hard and putting in my best work.</p>
