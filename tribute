      Elena was my teammate in the summer research fellowship this summer and she is inspiring because she puts a lot of effort into getting the things she needs to get done finished. She is a determined individual and will find a solution to any problem she encounters. Not only that, her reliability is one of her best traits as she is able to help others around her and collaborate effectively. Her work ethic is just part of who she is and she is also very amicable and a fun person to talk to. She inspires me to continue working hard and putting in my best work.</p>
